# DVBS2 MATLAB implementation
This folder contains the code implementation of the functional blocks as described in the DVBS2 paper:
1. Mode adaptation
2. Stream adaptation
3. Forward error correction
4. Mapping
5. Physical layer framing
6. Base-Band Filtering and Quadrature Modulation

Each folder contains the implementation of the corresponding block. Some of it uses MATLAB's com library, other parts are own implementation of the COM team.

The code follows the guidelines as described in the image below:
