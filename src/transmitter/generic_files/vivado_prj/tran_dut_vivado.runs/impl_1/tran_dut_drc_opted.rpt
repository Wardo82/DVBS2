REQP-1839#19 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 u_interleaver_dut/u_Single_Port_RAM/ram_reg has an input control pin u_interleaver_dut/u_Single_Port_RAM/ram_reg/WEA[0] (net: u_interleaver_dut/u_Single_Port_RAM/we0_out) which is driven by a register (u_interleaver_dut/column_counter_out1_reg[1]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
