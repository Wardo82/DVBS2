UTLZ-1#1 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT
F7 Muxes over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more F7 Muxes cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 34686 of such cell types but only 26600 compatible sites are available in the target device. Please analyze your synthesis results and constraints to ensure the design is mapped to Xilinx primitives as expected. If so, please consider targeting a larger device.)ROOT
Related violations: <none>

UTLZ-1#2 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT
F8 Muxes over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more F8 Muxes cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 17210 of such cell types but only 13300 compatible sites are available in the target device. Please analyze your synthesis results and constraints to ensure the design is mapped to Xilinx primitives as expected. If so, please consider targeting a larger device.)ROOT

UTLZ-1#3 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT
LUT as Logic over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more LUT as Logic cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 388723 of such cell types but only 53200 compatible sites are available in the target device. Please analyze your synthesis results and constraints to ensure the design is mapped to Xilinx primitives as expected. If so, please consider targeting a larger device. Please set tcl parameter "drc.disableLUTOverUtilError" to 1 to change this error to warning.)ROOT
